## Software Features

#### Drive Train
* Custom swerve drive code for our modules, with kinematics and odometry
* All on-controller feedback loops to control precise speed and module angle
* Path following and pathfinding using PathplannerLib, can follow paths created in GUI
* High-frequency odometry (Inspired by team 6328)
* Full simulation using real swerve drive and module logic allowing for assurance of drive code and pathing logic

<!-- Simulated drive train, pathfollowing AND back and forth swerve bot -->

#### Driving
* Two controller scheme, drive and operator
* Strategic controller rumble for drivers to understand robot
* Elastic dashboard for key information
* Dashboard alerts for disconnected devices and other errors
* One button auto align for driver, automatically finds nearest scoring location
<!-- real robot scoring AND sim auto alignment  -->

#### Superstructure
* State based control to automatically reach setpoints while avoiding collisions
* Detection for when Coral is held, triggering different states
* All on-controller feedback loops, enhanced with feed forward to counter gravity and friction
* All logic fully simulated, including Coral holding allowing for easy debugging and auto creation
<!-- Real robot scoring on practice field AND simulated view of robot with operator control -->

#### Vision
* PhotonVision based full field localization
* Smart camera placement to view  April Tags
* Custom advanced filtering and standard deviations calculations to throw out bad results and trust good results more
* Kalman filter to integrate vision results with odometry data
* Allowed for smart auto alignment system and consistent autos when localization was used in pathing
<!-- Simulated vision AND real vision video AND vision setup diagram -->

#### Code structure
* AdvantageKit IO layers to separate control logic with hardware implantations, allowed for logic to be simulated on fake simulated hardware
* Full logging and real time monitoring on AdvantageScope to view robot state, whether simulated or real
* WPILib style command based programming with subsystems and command for clean reusable code
